# CS-wk1
Dear All,
 
A nice, quick task for you to complete in your books for next week Wednesday’s lesson:
 
1.)     Draw a flowchart for the following problem
2.)     Print out the 7 times-table
·       1 x 7 = 7
·       2 x 7 = 14
·       …
·       12 x 7 = 84
3.)     EXTENSION (optional)
·       Ask for the user to input which times-table they would like (eg above: 7)
·       Ask the user to input how far up the timetable to go (eg above: 12)
4.)     SUPER EXTENSION (super optional)
·       Code your solution up in either Scratch or Python (or a language of your choice!) and e-mail it to me as an attachment before the next lesson.
 
Please note that extension work is obviously optional but recommended. Good solutions will certainly be in line to earn T-Ticks, Optima etc.
 
Best Wishes,
 
Mr Boshoff
